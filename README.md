Introduce
CodeGen is a secure, high efficiency, and offline-able software, it provides several useful functions

We hope it can save your day from heavy redundant operations and reduce your workload to some extent. Our aim is, to write code more easily by using this software, we promise that we will keep updating its function and putting more useful functions on CodeGen.

Recently, we just released the Beta version, not merely the Windows platform but OSX(Mac) and Linux(Snap/AppImage) are supported as well. If you would like to experience the software of the Beta version, please refer to the download links in the section below.

About this Repository
We would like to hear our user's feedback and suggestions about the software via this repository on Github, therefore the main purpose of the repository is to solve issues and problems as much as we can. Meanwhile, there are lots of efforts that need to be spent on open-source such as code review, adding the supplementary comments, the prerequisites of local development, scrutinizing latent vulnerable defects, etc... Based on that, I'm afraid that CodeGen would publish its part source code firstly so far, and we will consider publishing its entire source code at the proper time. For any kinds of issues or suggestions, please feel free to contact us, much appreciated.
